It was incredible to receive \nmentorship from professionals in the venture capital space over the course of the 3 -week fellowship.

I\u2019ve been \nreally interested in startups and learn ing about how to get funding if I have a startup. However, through \nthis fellowship, I\u2019ve actually become more interested in the venture side. It\u2019s really cool to see that I can \nbe a founder and possibly even be a venture capitalist in the future.\u201c  \nBS\u201923, U T Dallas  \n\u201cJust having this Fellowship on your resume makes for a great talking point and has definitely given me \naccess to a lot of professional opportunities. It also shows potential future employers that I\u2019m motivated \nand driven, so it gives me a profess ional edge.  I\u2019m also better able to network more effectively and \nstrategically, a skill a learned as a Fellow.

He points to a partner organization \nin India where patients travel a full day or two from their village to get imaged. \u201c And then they\u2019re stuck \nwith this situation where it could take a week or a week and a half to have those images looked at,\u201d he \nsaid. \u201cDo you just wait in the city for a whole week before going back to your village? Or if you do decide \nto go back to your vi llage, do you want to come back?\u201d  \nMedCognetics\u2019 software means that patients\u2019 images can be reviewed more immediately. \u201cWithin a \ncouple of minutes, you could process the case and tell the patient, \u2018Yes, you should hang around or no, \nyou\u2019re free to go,\u2019\u201d Co gan said.  \nFor the U.S. market, Cogan emphasized that MedCognetics will not replace radiologists but will instead \nprovide a second read. \u201cI think the best thing is that we have people and AI working together, checking \neach other\u2019s work,\u201d he added. \u201cThen you  get the best possible outcome for the patient.\u201d  \nReceiving FDA clearance for its breast cancer screening software in December 2022 was a key milestone, \naccording to Cogan. \u201cThere are dozens of companies or groups doing work similar to ours, but my \nundersta nding is there\u2019s a single digit number of mammography AI groups that have actually have FDA \nclearance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty big hurdle to pass.\u201d  \nEarlier this year, MedCognetics received a $750,000 grant from the National Institute of Health\u2019s (NIH) \nArtificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Consortium to Advance Health Equity and Researcher Diversity.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2619, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "721fef15-fee9-405d-8b26-e94a324cf69f": {"__data__": {"id_": "721fef15-fee9-405d-8b26-e94a324cf69f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8ca7bceb-9121-41f5-95b1-8f154d6a66ec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship.pdf"}, "hash": "77a0cf740e6f58b0b320c155cb8242778cd745afdf094def3a075ec87e854fec"}}, "hash": "49318ce28054f850d63a1643d9a381629c626eb67e3a2baf15716ab29250138a", "text": "\u201cFrom the start, we\u2019ve really focused on getting data and partnering with doctors everywhere,\u201d Cogan \nsaid.  \nBy gathering data from patients all over the worl d, MedCognetics aims to train its AI and machine \nlearning technology on diverse populations so it works on every patient and every demographic. \u201cIf you \ntake your system and you just train it on a particular type of patient population, it\u2019s going to work re ally \nwell for those particular patients, but it won\u2019t necessarily work well on another group of patients,\u201d \nCogan explained. \u201cPeople in Southeast Asia have a totally different diet and totally different lifestyle than \npeople in say Central Texas, so cancer will manifest differently. You need your system tuned for people all \naround the world.\u201d  \nAs this technology improves, it might be applied in other medical settings beyond breast cancer \nscreenings, providing greater access to medical imaging around the world . \n \n \n \n    View all posts by sxc121330     \n \nOur mission at the Institute is to enable the next generation\u2019s new ventures.

In just over a year, his Etsy shop \nhas had over 2,500 sales. McBroom says it\u2019s a great test market because there\u2019s very little upfront \ninvestment needed. \u201cI\u2019m much more comfortable putting something on there where the customers \nalready are and seeing if people like it versus creating a whole Shopify store just to see if something \nworks,\u201d he explained. Strudel3D also sells through its own website now, too. McBroom still uses the \noriginal 3D printer, but it takes about 5 hours for one print, so he\u2019s also purchased another printer that \ntakes abou t one hour per print.  \nWhile earning his MBA at UTD, McBroom took a class in entrepreneurship and submitted an entry in the \nBig Idea Competition.

I had been slowly working on my company for 2 years, \nspending time planning and tweaking my idea. When I joined CometX, from the first day I was instantly \nset on track. Through the few wee ks that the course had been going on, my company had matured from \na small idea to a team of 6 people and a goal to have an MVP available by the end of the year. The \ndistinguished lectures gave several answers to questions we had not event thought about. Th e \naccelerator is structured in a way that helps form a clear guideline for some of the key points to creating \na startup, and the only thing I would change is to make it longer  \nThere are some events in life that change you and CometX is one of them. I came to the USA to pursue \nan education in Computer Science because almost all of the top CS companies I could name of started \nhere. There is something unique about building businesses in America that fosters such growth, and I \nbelieve programs like CometX are s uch an amazing gateway to them.  \nGoing through the entire program opened up such a breadth of knowledge that gave me the right set of \ntools and information to build an amazing product while making it into a business. I not only was able to \nshape my vision b ut it also kickstarted a series of events that led to ResumePuppy winning 2nd place in \nthe CometX pitch competition and then later winning the Big Idea Competition.  \nLeon Jacobson", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3308, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "adc9e308-a57e-4695-a1f3-10bec838908f": {"__data__": {"id_": "adc9e308-a57e-4695-a1f3-10bec838908f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39aa0880-33e3-4224-ab51-4e480f7c0655", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "65", "file_name": "Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship.pdf"}, "hash": "e6e2fe51edd66743078bd9c22def0b72ef37bddf0c2e87810f4224f967792f59"}}, "hash": "b62fccee70dbc02e2b6a59a84ae61cad16a9261a45e7bca24ee26c78fada3756", "text": "leon.jacobson@utdallas.edu  \nAssistant Director, Programs and Operations  \n  \n  \nOur mission at the Institute is to enable the next generation\u2019s new ventures.

Such is the case with  IgniteConnex Inc., a subsidiary of technology \nconsulting company CG Infinity set up to incubate new companies.  \nCG Infinity has now partnered with several faculty at the Naveen Jindal School of Management and the \nInstitute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship to create a new, year -long internship program called the \nInfinite Corporate Incubator Program.  \nThe idea grew out of a conversation between Rajiv Shah, Founder & Program Director for the Systems \nEngineering and Management (SEM) program at UT Dallas, and Professor of Practice, and Bhopi Dhall, \nfounder and CEO of CG Infinity. The two first met while working at Texas Instruments years ago, and \nDhall wanted to give back while also fostering innovation.  \nThrough furthe r conversations with Saurajit Kanungo, president and COO of CG Infinity, and Rob \nPalacios, Chief Innovation Officer/EVP at CG Infinity and President/Co -Founder at  IgniteConnex, Inc., \nthey arrived at the idea of an internship, but one where the university w ould help vet applications \ninstead of the company fielding applications.  \n\u201cThey wanted to have UTD Master\u2019s level students who can help them to understand what the customer \nrequirements are, understand the internal capabilities, and then take all that into launching new \ninitiatives,\u201d Shah says.  \nCG Infinity wanted to hire a small cohort of interns with complementary skillsets to work as a team and \nhelp incubate new startup ideas. During the fall of 2022, Shah looped in Paul Nichols, Assistant Professor \nof Pra ctice, and Emily Choi, Associate Professor of Instruction and Academic Director, Innovation and \nEntrepreneurship, to help conceptualize this internship program.  \n\u201cIn the past, when they went out and created solutions for their clients, they realized, \u2018wow, this solution \ncould actually be useful for more than just this one client, we should build a business around it and \nlaunch it,\u2019\u201d Choi says. \u201cBut going from the product or idea to launching into a business and scaling it, \nthat\u2019s a whole different process. T hat\u2019s what we teach in the innovation entrepreneurship program.\u201d  \nWorking with Fiona Hunter in UTD\u2019s Career Management Center and Angela Howard from the graduate \nadvising team, Shah, Nichols, and Choi formalized the program and opened applications on an \naccelerated timeline compared to most other internship processes. \u201cOne weekend, all three of us \nburned the midnight oil and we narrowed it down [from over 90] to 15 or 20 applicants,\u201d Shah says. They \nlooked for students who had real -world experience and the a bility to work as a team. Shah, Nichols, and \nChoi interviewed those 15 -20 applicants and shared their short list with CG Infinity, who then \ninterviewed finalists.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3051, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d8b918bd-8b32-43ea-a930-6b97a73d44fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "d8b918bd-8b32-43ea-a930-6b97a73d44fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "05261cd9-7b8e-4181-b7cb-614b49a3032c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship.pdf"}, "hash": "2169e0b9794d4fd03c0ae3ebc05cd498d91072c36bb08472ab30d7db9102de9a"}}, "hash": "ce11391504af6433c7b3b7859c05ac4748cdf80f85735a9fba8b3d75d0bbcbca", "text": "Ultimately, three Master of Science students in Business Analytics were chosen: Madhurima Madgula, \nNekitha Ramachandran, and Pakshal Shah.

But that itch to \njump into startups again led him to UT Dallas where he could earn his MBA and learn more about the \nentrepreneurial ecosystem in the US at the same time. Last year, Ivan spent an extended internship with \nthe venture capital firm Moonshots Capital.  \nDuring the last semester of my MSIE (Master\u2019s in Innovation and Entrepreneurship), I signed up to take \nthe Seed Fund Support Course (ENTP 4395 / 6377) with Professor Bryan Chambers. This was my first \nintroduction to the VC industry and, honestly, one of the best classes I attended in my whole education. \nDuring the semester, Professor Chambers mentioned the possibility for a few students to get a fellowship \nto work at a local VC firm after finishing the course. That immediately caught my a ttention; remember \nmy goal has always been to start my own company, so my thought was if I could join a VC firm I could \nprobably \u2018reverse engineer\u2019 and deeply understand one of the most critical and complicated parts of \nhaving a startup: raising funds.  \nSo, when the final presentations were completed I inquired with my professor about the fellowship. I \nwas soon connected with Craig Cummings, the General Partner and Co -founder of Moonshots Capital, a \nVC firm with offices in Austin and Los Angeles.  \nA quick not e: One the most important things I\u2019ve learned from this industry, and that I later reinforced \nworking at Moonshots; in the VC industry connections -introductions mean a lot, seriously.  \nI had two interviews, prior to being accepted into the fellowship. The f irst interview was with the main \nassociate of the firm, which later would become the person I would report to.

Lat er I learned that people in the VC industry come \nfrom very diverse backgrounds. I worked part -time at Moonshots for 11 months while also attending my \nMBA classes and having a full -time job. So no, it wasn\u2019t easy, but it was totally worth it.  \nMoonshots Capi tal invests in seed to late -seed stage startups, for example, tech companies raising \naround $2.5M to $5M where Moonshots may potentially lead the rounds. The whole firm operates \nremotely; however, during my time with them, I had the chance to fly to Austin  and LA to attend a few \nevents and meet the team; that was one of the richest experiences because I got the opportunity to \nmeet wonderful people, entrepreneurs, and investors doing exciting things.  \nDuring those 11 months, my role was to be the first point of contact between the firm and a potential \ninvestment opportunity. I would review hundreds of pitches every month to look out for the ones that \nhad potential, and that also fit the firm\u2019s portfolio strategy. If I came across a deck that seemed \ninteresting  and had potential, I would reach out to the company founders for an introductory call and \nsome additional information. If everything made sense, I would recommend that the main associate hold \na meeting with them. We would have a weekly meeting to discuss these potential opportunities, which \nwe would later share with the General Partners of the firm.  \nI take pride in \u2018having found\u2019 what I believe must have been the only investment that has come thru this \nchannel. Most of the investments the firm has done in the past, and I think this is common throughout \nthe industry, come from warm intros from other investors or founders previously funded. Yes, the vast \nmajority of pitches they get from cold emails, or the website never gets to the last stage of \nconsideratio n. And even if they do, 99% of deals end up in a non -investment decision. Many factors play \ninto this decision and go beyond this post\u2019s topic, but it was interesting to see and learn from it.  \nI was also there while the firm was in the process of raising i ts 3rd fund, which also was a unique and \nenriching experience to witness; they are on the run to raise $100M. It was very interesting to see that, \nin the end, the investors/firms also do the same thing that the founders do; they try to convince other \npeopl e to invest in their business opportunity. And when you understand and are aware of that, I think it \ngives you more clarity on how to approach a VC firm and raise funds for your venture.  \nSo, to conclude, here are two parting thoughts:  \n \n \n    View all posts by sxc121330     \n \nOur mission at the Institute is to enable the next generation\u2019s new ventures.

Co -founder and CEO John Kahn (BA\u201919) sat down with us to discuss his latest venture.  \nTell us about your new startup, Debuff  \nThe app is just a small piece of what we do. Our company\u2019s  aim is to create an ecosystem for the esports \nindustry.  We want to solve the  disconnected and overloaded  information in Esports across communities. \nNothing really works \u201ctogether\u201d in esports. People ea sily feel lost  and overwhelmed when they have to \nvisit varying websites for information and data. The app is the first step to that. It acts as the portal to \ninteract in esports.  We analyze and collect the best information to keep viewers and gamers involv ed and \ninformed of the performances of players in tournaments.  \nHow has the transition been from your corporate job at American Airlines  to the startup world?  \nWe started Debuff while I was still working full -time at American Airlines. I was making good mone y with \ngood benefits but it was beginning to become challenging to manage both. I started to realize that I \ncould no longer try to keep building my startup on the side. After leaving, I worked for about eight \nmonths full -time on a drone startup. Getting ba ck into startups lit the spark in me again because I really \ngravitate to that. My team and I decided to really get Debuff up and running this past August.  \nYou\u2019ve probably been working on this venture for some time, how did you begin building Debuff?   \nWe\u2019ve  had this idea since 2019. When we started working on the app we began to realize we couldn\u2019t do \nit as a side project. It\u2019s really a full -time job to build something this big. Actually, there was a period of \ntime when we didn\u2019t add any new features to the app because we simply weren\u2019t available to put 100% \nin due to our other work responsibilities. Now, that I am full -time we are making tremendous progress.  \nYou\u2019re live on the app store.

I am so glad I joined the program because it really changed the \ntrajectory of the rest of my time at UTD. It made me pull together a business concept and pitch deck, \nwhich I had never done before and also pitch for the first time.I ended up winning 3rd place in the GalXc \npitch competition. It wasn\u2019t even about the money so much as feeling like I can actually do this and \nmove it forward because someone liked it and believed in it. IDA is now in the middle of  our pilot/beta \nstage. We are working on increasing users for a later launch and building out the rest of the features. It \nwas approximately a year ago that I was in GalXc getting ready to pitch this. I am so grateful that I got to \nbe part of the 1st cohor t because it changed everything!  \nI had an amazing learning experience taking part in the GalXc program, an 8 -week accelerator program \nfor women entrepreneurs at The University of Texas at Dallas.  We learned about developing our business \nideas, differentiat ing and innovating, marketing our ideas, fundraising, managing legalities, among many \nother things. It was also very inspiring to be able meet successful entrepreneurs who shared with us \ntheir stories of how they made it happen. Additionally, I loved meeti ng with experienced investors and \nmentors who gave us valuable feedback on our pitches. The program helped me to develop my idea and \nenhance my entrepreneurial and presentation skills, as I came in Third place for the pitching \ncompetition. Overall, I would  highly recommend it to any budding entrepreneur looking to start their \nown business.  \nI participated in a GalXc pitch competition after completing the 2 -month GalXc program, where I learned \nvarious aspects of starting a startup. By the pitch competition, I  felt my concepts of startup building have \nadvanced. Particularly, the very important startup idea pitching skill I\u2019ve gained helped me win the \nsecond place in the competition.  \nThe LaunchPad network helps students succeed in entrepreneurship and in their c areers.

Our cohort had such a divers e \nbackground of academic and professional experiences; from people in the medical sciences to \nengineering students and English majors. I saw people who took unconventional paths to \nentrepreneurship and was inspired to believe I could too.   \nThe Bridge Vent ure Fellowship is a 3 -week paid learning opportunity for historically excluded students to \nlearn about venture capital and network with peers and industry professionals. The virtual bootcamp is \nopen to 20 students across the UT System schools and culminate s in an in -person recruitment mixer in \nAustin with Texas -based venture capital firms.   \nThe Bridge Venture Fellowship program supports students who have not previously had opportunities to \nlearn about venture capital and encourages Black, Latinx, women, LGB TQ+ students, and those who \nsupport them to apply.

The sensor \nevaluation follows a successful technology development work in partnership with the lab of Professor \nAmy Walker at The University of Texas at Dallas (UTD), under SBIR funding from the National Science \nFound ation (NSF).   \nTreatment of municipal sewage is a very energy -intensive process: it accounts for over 1% of total U.S. \nelectric energy consumption. In -line monitoring of nitrogen contaminants, such as nitrate and ammonia, \nat a WWTP using Max -IR\u2019s sensor can  enable automated controls and optimization of the wastewater \ntreatment process, resulting in significant energy savings. Municipal sewage is treated in industrial -scale \nbioreactors, where the metabolic activities of various microorganisms are used for bio degradation of the \nnitrogen contaminants into N2 gas. This treatment requires aeration \u2013 a process in which air is passed \nthrough the treated wastewater. Aeration represents over 50% of the WWTP electric power \nconsumption. However, implementation of real -time controls based on in -line sensors can reduce energy \nconsumption due to aeration by as much as 20%.   \nMax -IR Labs\u2019 sensor technology is based on pre -concentration of contaminants using ion -selective \nmaterials, and subsequent infrared (IR) spectroscopy fo r detection of the nitrogen -based contaminants.   \nIf implemented across all municipal WWTPs in the U.S., energy savings would equate to a reduction of \nroughly 2M metric tons of CO2 per year from reduced electric power generation/usage.   This is roughly \nequi valent to CO2 reduction from converting 900,000 cars from gasoline to electric, or about the number", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2739, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f0c7b1d-c669-4575-a070-767ed5031e34": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f0c7b1d-c669-4575-a070-767ed5031e34", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "191", "file_name": "Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6f8916ec-8721-4625-a9ca-397873990d2e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "191", "file_name": "Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship.pdf"}, "hash": "82a880741faff50d1722ab101aa527119990b99b4430931e039671ea10061dbb"}}, "hash": "24237c3d5b3790a50f4f73eb6168287f438bb86c6e144ffe61ba6ff2838dea23", "text": "of Tesla cars sold in 2021.

Beyond detection of nitrogen compounds at WWTPs, Max -IR Labs\u2019 sensors can be utilized to \ncontrol processes in other industrial and lab -scale bioreactors.   \nMethods developed by Max -IR Labs for analysis of environmental water has led to new R&D efforts \nfocused on detection of harmful perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), as well as toxic industrial m aterials \n(TICs) and toxic industrial chemicals (TIMs) in water.
